        <div class="text"><h3>Description</h3>
        Steak and frites is a delicious homemade meal that incorporates restaurant quality technique. Steak and frites is rather 
        vague in it's description alone which allows for plenty of interpretation. Firstly, choose your favorite cut of beef. For 
        me, I prefer a New York strip steak but to each their own. Secondly, choice of potatoe allows some freedom. I personally 
        choose to go with russet potatoes.
