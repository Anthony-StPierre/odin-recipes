        pasta recipe utilizes very few ingredients and minimal steps to complete. For the sauce base, heavy cream or half/half are suitable. Anything lighter in 
        fat content might stray too far from the desired consistency and taste. Chicken or shrimp can be added to this dish to 
        include a textural component and additional protein source. This recipe allows the freedom to choose your
